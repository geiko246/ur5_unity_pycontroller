# Python Controller for Unity

All credit for the original UR5 Unity controller and prefabs goes to Long Qian and Shuyang Chen.

The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/qian256/ur5_unity).

This project uses a socket connection between the Unity environment and the python script to control the robotic arm. The existing python script in this repository is simply a demo. To run the demo, load the project into Unity and press play. Then, launch the Python script.

### Dependencies

#### Python
socket:
``` pip install socket ```
